This project focuses on analyzing transportation modes of Bergamo city (such as walking 
and riding a bus) using location tracking data collected via a GPX file. The goal is to derive 
transportation modes based on the variation of speed throughout a trajectory, using QGIS 
for data processing and Python for calculating speed and determining modes of transport. 
The project demonstrates how to process real-world movement data, analyze the results, 
and compare them with a manually logged ground truth of transportation times.
